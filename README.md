# slot-machine

The purpose of this project was to try and code a simple slot machine but also implement the mathematics of the payout percentage. In the excel file you can see how the numbers work in order to create a payout percentage of 98.33%. 

The slot machine displays the results as number ranging from 1 to 4 with 3 chambers. The different combinations which can provide a win are as follows (payout percentages are rounded):

- Pair of 1s pays 103%

- Pair of 2s pays 105%

- Triple 1s pays 110%

- Triple 4s 119%

- Triple 3s pays 134%
